  bio: `
I am a Junior Frontend Developer with almost a year of commercial experience. I have a head full of ideas for improving myself in different areas. I love building complex logic in front-end applications and connecting end users to the API.
I have a Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics, meaning I can't function without figuring out how different things work. (Trust me, you don't want to watch a movie with me ;P)
